# Covid_19_Data_Analysis
The COVID-19 Data Analysis project utilizes Python and Pandas to process and analyze COVID-19 case data. The project aims to extract meaningful insights from the dataset, including confirmed cases, recoveries, and regional impacts.

**Features**

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing trends in confirmed and recovered cases.

Data Aggregation: Summarizing COVID-19 statistics based on region.

Statistical Insights: Identifying regions with the highest confirmed and recovered cases.

Filtering & Grouping: Extracting country-specific data for deeper analysis.

**Technologies Used**

Python (for data analysis)

Pandas (for data manipulation and aggregation)

Jupyter Notebook (for interactive data exploration)


**Future Improvements**

Adding data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Integrating time-series analysis to track case growth over time.

Expanding the dataset to include vaccination statistics.
